        <h1>The Second Winter in Ottawa</h1>
        <p>Rancy stood by the frosted window, fingers wrapped around a mug of masala chai, watching delicate snowflakes melt against the glass. It had been three months since she moved to Ottawa from Kochi. The city, white and sprawling, felt like a blank canvas — or a test she hadn’t studied for.</p>

        <p>Nick, her husband of two years, was kind, soft-spoken, and relentlessly structured. An analyst by day and a Netflix documentary buff by night, he kept their apartment warm and their routines warmer. But routine was precisely what began to feel like a gentle cage.</p>

        <p>The apartment next door had been empty when she arrived. That changed the day Prince moved in.</p>

        <p>He was everything Ottawa wasn’t — sun-drenched, unruly, loud in his laughter and casual in his charm. Their first conversation happened over shared groceries in the hallway. The second, over wine. The third — over a song she hadn’t heard since college.</p>

        <p>The first time they crossed the line, it wasn’t planned. Rancy had been helping Prince unpack a box of old vinyls. Music floated between them, low and heady, as a storm raged outside. He reached for her hand to show her a record sleeve, and she didn’t let go. Her breath hitched as his fingers trailed her wrist. A look passed — questioning, loaded, unspoken — and then they kissed, deeply, hungrily. It wasn’t just physical; it was release, a gasp after years of holding her breath. They tumbled back onto the couch, intoxicated by desire and by the idea that someone finally saw her.</p>

        <p>She hadn’t realized she was starving — not for love, but for attention, spontaneity, a mirror that showed her more than "wife."</p>

        <p>The affair began on a Thursday. Snow fell in sheets. Prince kissed her as if they were in a film that could never be rewound.</p>

        <p>Nick found out the way most men do — not through confrontation, but through intuition. He didn’t rage. He simply sat her down, eyes heavy, and asked, “Do you still love me, Rancy?”</p>

        <p>She wept. For her choices. For the honesty. For the way he said her name like it still belonged to him.</p>

        <p>“I don’t know what I was looking for,” she whispered.</p>

        <p>“I know,” he replied. “But I still see the girl I married. And I want her back — if she wants this too.”</p>

        <p>It took time. The second winter in Ottawa was longer than the first. Rancy deleted every message, ended things with Prince, and began again — this time with slower walks, more conversations, and the courage to admit when something felt missing.</p>

        <p>Forgiveness, she learned, wasn’t the absence of pain — but the presence of hope.</p>
